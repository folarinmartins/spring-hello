# spring-hello
In this project, I'll take you through a step-by-step process of deploying a microservices-based application architecture using Spring Boot and other projects such as Spring Cloud, Spring Data, etc.

Highlights include
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry and Jaeger
- Centralized loggin with Graylog
- Dockerizing the application
- Publishing docker image to docker hub
- creating a docker-compose.yml
- deploying the application in docker using docker-compose up
- deploying the application as a service using docker service create
- updating the docker-compose.yml as a service
- creating a mysql database container with an attached name volume
- creating networks and experimenting with various network modes: overlay, bridge, none, host
- passing in database configuration parameters to spring boot via application.properties file and docker-compose file
- initializing a docker swarm with single node
- modifying our docker-compose.yml for deployment to the swarm
- deploying and scaling our services in the swarm
- adding other worker and manager nodes to our docker swarm container orchestrator

So, sit tight for an interesting learning experience in the world of microservices with more topics to be covered by demands.

If you fancy good technology, then let's begin the journey.
